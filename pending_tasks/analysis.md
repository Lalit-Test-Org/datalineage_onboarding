## Technical Risks and Considerations

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Complexity of Field-Level Lineage**: Automatic discovery across different data formats (Avro, XSD, Oracle) will require sophisticated matching algorithms
2. **Performance at Scale**: Graph traversal and visualization may become slow with large numbers of fields and relationships
3. **External System Integration**: Unknown APIs and access patterns for trading and external systems
4. **Data Quality**: Ensuring accuracy of discovered lineage relationships will be challenging

### Technical Debt Considerations
1. **Current UI Dependencies**: UI has unmet dependencies that need to be resolved
2. **Deprecated Service**: `datalineage-discovery-service` marked as deprecated but still exists
3. **Authentication**: Kerberos support is commented out in Oracle service
4. **Testing**: Limited test infrastructure exists

### Architectural Recommendations
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Consider using Kafka for inter-service communication
2. **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed metadata
3. **Database Strategy**: Move from H2 to production database (PostgreSQL) for lineage storage
4. **API Versioning**: Implement proper API versioning strategy for backward compatibility

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Backend Developers**: 3-4 Java/Spring Boot developers
- **Frontend Developer**: 1 React/TypeScript developer
- **DevOps Engineer**: 1 for infrastructure and deployment
- **Data Engineer**: 1 for schema analysis and lineage algorithms

### Infrastructure
- **Additional Services**: 6 new microservices

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)

2. **Clean Up Deprecated Code**: Remove or properly integrate datalineage-discovery-service
3. **Infrastructure Setup**: Set up development environment with required services
4. **Team Formation**: Assemble development team with required skills

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with Avro schema management service
2. **UI Foundation**: Complete UI dependency resolution and basic testing
3. **Database Migration**: Move from H2 to PostgreSQL for production readiness
4. **API Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI documentation for existing services

This analysis provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the complete data lineage system. The phased approach ensures critical functionality is delivered first while building towards the complete end-to-end lineage capability.
