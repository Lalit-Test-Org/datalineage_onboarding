# Data Lineage System Gap Analysis and Implementation Tasks

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current state of the `datalineage_onboarding` repository against the required end-to-end data lineage observation capabilities. The target data flow **already exists** in production systems. The purpose of this DataLineage project is to **observe and trace** data flowing through these existing systems at the field level, providing comprehensive lineage visibility from Trading System to File Transfer Component.

   - Oracle metadata discovery and extraction (tables, columns, procedures, constraints)
   - Direct and Kerberos authentication support
   - Connection management and testing
   - Graph-based visualization of Oracle metadata relationships

2. **Microservice Architecture**
   - Spring Boot microservices with service discovery
   - API Gateway for routing
   - Modular service structure (metadata, lineage, oracle-discovery)
   - RESTful APIs with standardized responses

3. **Frontend UI**
   - React-based UI with TypeScript
   - Interactive graph visualization using Cytoscape.js
   - Oracle connection management interface

   - Interactive exploration with search and filtering
   - Multiple layout algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical, grid, circular)

### ‚ùå Missing Critical Components

Based on the required data flow, the following major components are completely missing:

## Target Data Flow Analysis

**Existing Production Flow**: Trading System ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Ingestion System ‚Üí Oracle (`rawdata`) ‚Üí Reporting System ‚Üí Oracle (`report`) ‚Üí UI Component ‚Üí Submission Component ‚Üí CSV/XML files ‚Üí File Transfer Component

## Technical Risks and Considerations

### High-Risk Areas
1. **External System Integration Complexity**: Connecting to existing trading, ingestion, and reporting systems may require custom adapters and API understanding
2. **Field-Level Lineage Discovery Accuracy**: Automatic discovery across different data formats (Avro, Oracle, XML/CSV) requires sophisticated matching algorithms
3. **Performance at Scale**: Graph traversal and visualization may become slow with large numbers of fields and cross-system relationships
4. **System Availability Dependencies**: LineAge system depends on availability and accessibility of existing production systems
5. **Data Security and Access**: Observing production systems requires appropriate security clearances and read-only access patterns

### Technical Debt Considerations
1. **Current UI Dependencies**: UI has unmet dependencies that need to be resolved
2. **Deprecated Service**: `datalineage-discovery-service` marked as deprecated but still exists
3. **Authentication**: Kerberos support is commented out in Oracle service
4. **Testing**: Limited test infrastructure exists

### Architectural Recommendations
1. **Read-Only Integration Pattern**: Ensure all external system integrations are read-only to avoid impacting production systems
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Consider using Kafka for internal lineage system communication and metadata updates
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed external system metadata to reduce load
4. **Database Strategy**: Move from H2 to production database (PostgreSQL) for lineage metadata storage
5. **API Versioning**: Implement proper API versioning for integration adapters to handle external system changes
6. **Connection Pooling**: Implement efficient connection pooling for external system integrations

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Backend Developers**: 3-4 Java/Spring Boot developers
- **Frontend Developer**: 1 React/TypeScript developer
- **DevOps Engineer**: 1 for infrastructure and deployment
- **Data Engineer**: 1 for schema analysis and lineage algorithms
